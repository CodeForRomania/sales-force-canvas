<h2 class="sub-title">Canvas App Starter Kit</h2>
<p>This kit is designed for JavaScript developers who have an existing web application and would like to bring it to the Salesforce ecosphere. Canvas allows you to present your app(s) within the Salesforce domain and interact with Salesforce data, providing a seamless experience for your customers. Canvas apps can be the primary component of a Managed Package, allowing you to present your app on the Salesforce AppExchange. This is a Node.js version of the <span><a href="https://github.com/seedcode/canvas-starter-kit" target="_blank">Canvas Starter Kit</a></span> published by Seedcode for AngularJS developers. That project is a close approximation of the approach they have taken in developing and publishing their <span><a href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000000qp64EAA" target="_blank">DayBack</a></span> application to the AppExchange. This kit draws heavily on the <a href="https://resources.docs.salesforce.com/sfdc/pdf/canvas_framework.pdf" target="_blank">Salesforce Documentation for Canvas</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceCanvasJavascriptSDK" target="_blank">JavaScript Canvas SDK</a>, which is included. We recommend becoming familar with both of these resources when working with this kit.</p>
<h2 class="sub-title">Using This Kit</h2>
<p>This kit is built using <span><a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a></span>, and should be a good starting point for Node.js developers. The canvas-all.js file is the primary component of Salesforce's JavaScript SDK. The canvas-starter.js file is our example file, and should be a great starting point for your app's functions, and for taking advantage of the SDK. The chapters in this kit are for an overview and demonstration; for fuller documentation, refer to the repo on <span><a href="https://github.com/sumanpoluri/canvas-starter-kit" target="_blank">GitHub</a></span>.</p>
<h2 class="sub-title">Installing this kit</h2>
<p>You can get install instructions, and download or fork the kit, from <span><a href="https://github.com/sumanpoluri/canvas-starter-kit" target="_blank">GitHub</a></span>. The kit contains a template for your web app, and the Package components Seedcode uses in DayBack.</p>
